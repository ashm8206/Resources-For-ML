# Resources-For-ML
Here  is a curated list of Resources for Machine Learning
## A. Machine Learning
1) My personal favourite, I started my datascience journey with this and I recommend it as a starting point,not too heavy on the math though [Data-mining Concept and Techniques](http://myweb.sabanciuniv.edu/rdehkharghani/files/2016/02/The-Morgan-Kaufmann-Series-in-Data-Management-Systems-Jiawei-Han-Micheline-Kamber-Jian-Pei-Data-Mining.-Concepts-and-Techniques-3rd-Edition-Morgan-Kaufmann-2011.pdf)

2) Complement the above with this to ease into the math [A comprehensive overview of ML, with a lot of technicalities explained: Machine Learning by Tom Mitchell](http://profsite.um.ac.ir/~monsefi/machine-learning/pdf/Machine-Learning-Tom-Mitchell.pdf)

## B. Getting into the mathematics:
   ### Probability
 - 1A) I belive this is a far better book to get into probability than the one that follows [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Christopher Bishop](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf)
 - 1B) Read on the mathematical foundations bit,just basics the math is still too difficult to comprehend for a beginner by my guesstimate [Pattern Classification - Duda, Hart](https://github.com/Jane333/Mustererkennung/blob/master/Pattern%20Classification%20by%20Richard%20O.%20Duda%2C%20David%20G.%20Stork%2C%20Peter%20E.Hart%20.pdf)
 
 You may start either with 1A / 1B, i strongly recommend 1A + 2 to get a hold on probability
 - 2A) Follow quickly with [Bayesian Reasoning And Machine Learning](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/textbook/090310.pdf)
 - 2B) Probability bits from [All of Statistics: A Concise course in statistical inference by Larry Wasserman](http://www.bioinfo.org.cn/~wangchao/maa/w.statistic.pdf)
 - 3) Supplement with the following to dvelve into scary math territory [Ian Goodfellow book on Deep learning](https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf/blob/master/complete-book-pdf/deeplearningbook.pdf)
  
 ### Statistics
  - 1) Start with this and no other  [All of Statistics: A Concise course in statistical inference by Larry Wasserman](http://www.bioinfo.org.cn/~wangchao/maa/w.statistic.pdf)
  - 2) Easy and implemented in python [Think stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/thinkstats.pdf)
  - 3) [Statistics with R by Andy Field](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1446200469) **Especially to Learn R**
  - 4) Just to Compliment above readings you may try out[Intro to bayesian statistics by William Bolstad](https://thenigerianprofessionalaccountant.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/intro-bayesian-statistics.pdf)
  - 5) Finish with this, this by far is the most challenging and detailed explanations[The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference and Prediction](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)


### Information theory
Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms by David J.C. MacKay [http://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf]

### Linear Algebra

- 1) One by 3Blue1Brown [Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
- 2) Linear algebra bits from this book [Ian Goodfellow book on Deep learning](https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf/blob/master/complete-book-pdf/deeplearningbook.pdf)
- 3) Try out for **solving sums** [Introduction to Linear Algebra By Gilbert Strang](https://math.feld.cvut.cz/ftp/krajnik/vyuka/ua/linalgeb.pdf)<br>
        More to come....
