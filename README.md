# Resources-For-ML
Here  is a curated list of Resources for Machine Learning

1) My personal favourite, I started my datascience journey with this and I recommend it as a starting point,not too heavy on the math though [Data-mining Concept and Techniques](http://myweb.sabanciuniv.edu/rdehkharghani/files/2016/02/The-Morgan-Kaufmann-Series-in-Data-Management-Systems-Jiawei-Han-Micheline-Kamber-Jian-Pei-Data-Mining.-Concepts-and-Techniques-3rd-Edition-Morgan-Kaufmann-2011.pdf)

2) Complement the above with this to ease into the math [A comprehensive overview of ML, with a lot of technicalities explained: Machine Learning by Tom Mitchell](http://profsite.um.ac.ir/~monsefi/machine-learning/pdf/Machine-Learning-Tom-Mitchell.pdf)

## B. Getting into the mathematics: 
 1 A) I belive this is a far better book to get into probability than the one that follows [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Christopher Bishop](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf)
 1 B) Read on the mathematical foundations bit,just basics the math is still too difficult to comprehend for a beginner by my guesstimate [Pattern Classification - Duda, Hart] (https://github.com/Jane333/Mustererkennung/blob/master/Pattern%20Classification%20by%20Richard%20O.%20Duda%2C%20David%20G.%20Stork%2C%20Peter%20E.Hart%20.pdf)
 
 You may start either with 1A / 1B, i strongly recommend 1A + 2 to get a hold on probability
 2) Follow quickly with [Bayesian Reasoning And Machine Learning](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/textbook/090310.pdf)
 
 3) Supplement with to dvelve into scary math territory [Ian Goodfellow book on Deep learning](https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf/blob/master/complete-book-pdf/deeplearningbook.pdf)
  
 


(4) For (nearly) full-blown ML with most foundations explained:
