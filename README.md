# Resources-For-ML
Here  is a curated list of Resources for Machine Learning

1) My personal favourite, I started my datascience journey with this and I recommend it as a starting point,not too heavy on the math though [Data-mining Concept and Techniques](http://myweb.sabanciuniv.edu/rdehkharghani/files/2016/02/The-Morgan-Kaufmann-Series-in-Data-Management-Systems-Jiawei-Han-Micheline-Kamber-Jian-Pei-Data-Mining.-Concepts-and-Techniques-3rd-Edition-Morgan-Kaufmann-2011.pdf)
2) Complement the above with this to ease into the math [A comprehensive overview of ML, with a lot of technicalities explained: Machine Learning by Tom Mitchell](http://profsite.um.ac.ir/~monsefi/machine-learning/pdf/Machine-Learning-Tom-Mitchell.pdf)

(3) Getting into the mathematics: 
Pattern Classification - Duda, Hart - http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Cl...


(4) For (nearly) full-blown ML with most foundations explained:
Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Christopher Bishop - http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Re...
The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference and Prediction - free online copy linked here:  http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~ti...
